====

Encoding is a library for working with compressed arrays of integers.   The compression algorithms used are different from typical general purpose algorithms such as Gzip, Snappy, etc. They are more commonly found in search engines (inverted indexes) and columnar databases.

## Features

* 32 and 64 bit version of the Simple family of integer compression algortithms (Simple9/Simple8b)
* 64 bit timestamp encoding
* Delta encoding

## Todo
*  Implement PFORDelta
*  Implement FPC
